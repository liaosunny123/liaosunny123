I'm a Grade Third student of WuHan University, pursuing a bachelor's degree.  

# Homepage
New Research home page is under construct.

# Research
I am dedicated to building efficient and reliable distributed deep learning frameworks, with a strong interest in areas such as LLM-based reinforcement learning, agent systems, on-device optimization, and edge computing. My current research focuses on the following areas:
- Federated Learning: Addressing the challenges of collaborative training on heterogeneous datasets, Tackling the problem of parameter misalignment across local LLMs in federated settings.
- Deep Learning Frameworks: Developing high-performance and reliable distributed training and inference systems.
- Edge Computing & On-Device LLM Optimization: Enhancing the efficiency of LLM inference on edge devices and resource-constrained environments.

# Development
In addition to my research interests, I am also deeply passionate about software development. I have a strong enthusiasm for distributed system architecture and middleware optimization. I have hands-on experience designing and optimizing production-level systems that handle tens of millions of daily requests. My personal interests include:
- Efficient Distributed System Architecture: Designing modern, cloud-native systems capable of supporting high concurrency and scalability.
- System Framework Design: Building highly decoupled system frameworks that provide robust, developer-friendly services for third-party integration.
I also have extensive project experience in mobile, client-side, and full-stack web development, covering both frontend and backend technologies.

# Reverse
Lastly, I have a strong interest in reverse engineering and possess extensive practical experience in the field. This includes:
- JS Obfuscation Reversal: Analyzing and deobfuscating complex obfuscated web JS code.
- Android Native Code Recovery: Reversing obfuscated native libraries and restoring algorithm logic.
- Network Traffic Analysis: Capturing and analyzing network packets for protocol understanding and debugging.
